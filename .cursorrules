# Writing Style Rules

## Tone and Voice
- Write everything very personally, as if two friends are speaking to each other
- Use conversational, friendly, and approachable language
- Avoid corporate jargon and formal business language
- Write in first person when appropriate ("I", "we", "you")
- Use contractions naturally (don't, can't, we're, it's)
- Be genuine, authentic, and relatable
- Show enthusiasm and personality
- Use simple, clear language that feels natural in conversation

## Content Guidelines
- Address the reader directly as "you" (or "tu" in French)
- Share personal insights and motivations
- Explain things as you would to a friend
- Use examples and relatable scenarios
- Be honest about challenges and learnings
- Celebrate wins together with the reader
- Make it feel like a conversation, not a sales pitch

## Language-Specific Notes
- English: Use "you" and conversational American English
- French: Use "tu" (informal) and conversational French, matching the friendly tone
