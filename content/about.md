This the website and blog for tracking the progress of the implementation of a business idea. It helps me learn many different things while providing the knowledge of those things to anyone.

The goal of Keepin' Tracks is to provide simple to use applications to interact with data. I'm going to start by providing 2 apps template that will be for sale on Etsy. 

The first appplication will be a personal finances tracking one. It helped keep track of my finances and provided me a great visibility of my expenses and net worth. The goal is provide a new tool for everyone that keeps doing their finances unproductively through spreadsheets.
It is still spreadsheet logic behind the application, but the user experience is much more enjoyable.

The second application is a journaling and tracking system to help people reach goals, track their moods, or leave a legacy for their future self about their every day emotions. This application helped me develop new healthy habits by encouraging me to track those habits and see the actual progress I made every day by displaying great graphic visuals.

In the future, I hope to expand the solutions to many more area and even target small businesses to help them in their too often chaotic data management.

Enjoy your visit on the website.

Feel free to contact me for requests or feedbacks.
