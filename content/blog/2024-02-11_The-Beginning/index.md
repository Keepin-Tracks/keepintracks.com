So I guess I have to start writing about the process.

I made the decision to go through with my business idea, and I must go through as well with the documentation of the process part.

I won't use AI generative BOT for the content of my posts. I want to stay as real as possible. I want to provide human readable content for those embarking on the same journey.

Just to put you in the same place I am, here are the things I did to arrive at this first blog post.

1. Struggle many years about finding what kind of business to start
2. Start making the engagement of actually starting a business in the near future
3. Struggle about sitting down on a precise idea
4. Finally agree to resale digital solutions on Etsy
5. Develop a solution that is better than solutions customer are already purchasing
6. Brainstorm on a business name to sell the solutions from
    * Keepin' Tracks: Because we are in the era of data, and company keeps track of ours, which we often have no control on. Part of my solutions is to put the data in control of the users, so they keep tracks of their data and can use and analyse it through the same tool.
7. Enumerate all the elements to deal with in order to start a proper business
    * Using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) schema tool, I mapped everything I knew I would have to implement to set great foundations
8. Start implementing the elements one by one
    * Website: Sit on a technology to help build the website and blog. That's where I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Qubt](https://github.com/chrede88/qubt) theme to get started with a functional blog website and start writing my first article.

Now, here I am. I know I've skipped some details about how I built the website for those not familiar with web development, but I will go through it in a next blog post. I will show the process which I followed to have an online website at keepintracks.com

This will engage some expenses, which I will need to start tracking. There comes the development of my first small business solution for those just starting out needing to track expenses.

Until then here's my quote of the day: "Life is a learning journey"
Came out of my mind, but if it exist feel free to tell me, and I'll quote properly.
