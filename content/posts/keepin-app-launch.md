Hey! I'm super excited to tell you that **Keepin' App is finally live** and ready for you to use!

I've been working on this for months, and honestly, I can't wait for you to try it out. It's been a journey, and I'm really proud of what I've built.

## So, What's Keepin' App?

Think of it as your personal tracking system. I've always been switching between different apps to track my workouts, my spendings, my weight, and even my thoughts. That's why I built Keepin' App — to bring everything together in one place.

Here's what you can track:
- **Your Health**: Your workouts, your weight, all that good stuff
- **Your Mind**: Journal your thoughts, track your mental wellness
- **Your Wealth**: Keep an eye on your finances, net worth, and budgets

## Why I Built This

You know what? I got tired of juggling spreadsheets and five different apps just to understand my own life. I thought, "There's got to be a better way." So I built one. And the best part? It's completely free, because I believe everyone should have access to tools that help them understand themselves better.

## How do I make money from it?
There is a **Shop** section in the app with a list of affiliated products from which I can earn a commission. When you buy any of those items, I earn money that might eventually enable be to work full time on the app while you don't pay a dime more than what you would have paid anywhere else.

## Ready to Give It a Try?

Seriously, just head over to [app.keepintracks.com](https://app.keepintracks.com) and create your account. It takes like two minutes, and you can start tracking right away. No credit card, no catch — just you and your data.

I'm genuinely excited to see how Keepin' App helps you on your journey. Let me know what you think!
