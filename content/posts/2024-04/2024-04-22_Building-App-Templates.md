So my posts are maybe desconstruct and not really easy to follow. But for now I'm only trying to build a new habit.

Today, we will put the base in place for something that matters to me: Personal Data Tracking

## 3 Apps
Why 3 apps? Because something stuck with me when I read Tools of Titans or Tribe of Mentors from Tim Ferris. He splitted his book in 3 sections: Mind, Body and Wealth. These three categories countains a lot of personal data we can track in our everyday life in order to optimize the quality of them.

### Wealth Tracker
An app to track personal finances and focus on growing personal wealth. 

### Health Tracker
An app to track physical activities and other things related to the health of the body and the mind.

### Mind Tracker
An app to track thoughts and journal about anything as well as a foundation for goal setting.

## Creating a public template
1. With our Appsheet account, we will create a blank app.
2. By accessing the Manage side menu we will run Deployment Check.
3. Once deployment pass, we can deploy the app.
4. Then we can access the Collaborate & Publish section
5. By clicking on Team work I can make the app a public Sample.
6. Now I can click on my account image at the top and click the first item in the dropdown
7. This will open a new tab, where we need to access the collab tab
8. Input a short description for your portfolio of public templates and save
9. Repeat for other templates

Now I have an Appsheet page with all my templates for public download right [Here](https://www.appsheet.com/portfolio/503437487)
