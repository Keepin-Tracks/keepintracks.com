title: 'Managing Tasks With Github'
---

Now I officially started this project. I need to stay current with my tasks and make sure I continually progress in a timely manner. I could work on things and ideas that pop out of my head, but it's not very productive.

For this, I will try to make the most out of Github, what I first thought to be a cloud for code lines.

## Entering Github
When we want to organize our things, we first need to find a clean environment where we will order our stuff. For that purpose, Github provides the ability to create an Organization, which is like a supercharged user account.

If the times come that I bring collaborators into my project, it will already be set up to invite them in easily and securely. For those not knowing anything about Github, sees it as a iCloud or OneDrive service where I now have a Organization account instead of my personal account.

## Entering Organization & Repositories
Right now you are viewing this article on a website. The website is currently hosted by Github itself at the moment of writing. Depending on the traffic, Github will continue to host it for free. How does it do it?

By publishing the code needed to generate the website on a public repository, I have told Github to deploy the website on the internet. This was the first repository of the project, our first box in our new environment to organize everything in regard to the website content. Found [Here](https://github.com/Keepin-Tracks/keepintracks.com).

On that repository, me and anyone can create issues regarding the website. This way I know what needs to be worked on. These issues are public, so in order to privately manage my tasks, I can create a project where I will assign my tasks on a timeline, and can easily track the progress of each one more in details.
