At Keepin' App, your security and privacy are our top priorities. We've implemented several advanced security features to protect your data.

## Hide Email Support

We support **hide email** functionality, allowing you to sign up without revealing your real email address. This adds an extra layer of privacy protection.

## Password Manager Integration

Keepin' App works seamlessly with all major password managers:
- 1Password
- LastPass
- Bitwarden
- Apple Keychain
- And more

We encourage using strong, unique passwords generated by your password manager for maximum security.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to your account. We support:
- **TOTP apps** (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- **SMS verification** (optional)
- **Backup codes** for account recovery

## Your Data is Encrypted

All your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure your personal information remains secure.

## Privacy by Design

We believe in privacy by design - your data belongs to you. We never sell your information, and you can export or delete your data at any time.

Stay secure, stay private with Keepin' App.
