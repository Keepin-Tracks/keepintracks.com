# Am I doing what I want to do without feeling much pre-game pain?

Let's say you told yourself you wanted to start running and exercising. What are your thoughts before you actually start doing those things, or what are your thoughts when you convince yourself to not do it at the moment?

Are you feeling discomfort about your environment, not wanting to train in warm weather or cold weather? Are you anticipating the incomfort of your equipment, shoes or clothes?

When you are about to eat a desert, you only feel joy in the moments leading to the flavors melting on your tongue. You anticipate the sugar rush and the taste of the exclusive and limited flavors you selected at your local donut store.

What about running and sweating from your ass crack and feeling the pain of muscles stretching and discomfort of your breath trying to keep you alive? We anticipate those, and our brain's survival instinct tries its best to convince you not to put yourself in that situation.

# How can I convince my brain

You've already read it many many times, that when your vision is clear, you can withstand the efforts required of you.

What if there was something else that could help, other than the elusive statement of having a clear vision.

## What if there was no pain to begin with?
To run, means pain.
To put on shoes, means you are going somewhere.
Are you putting on shoes already? Probably everyday...

Why don't you tell yourself to put on your running shoes everyday, because you are becoming an athlete. This and only this is your new goal.

What you do once you've put on the running shoes is up to you, but once you've put them on, your goal is accomplished and you can feel great about yourself.

## What if tracking your behaviors is painful
I feel you. Opening you computer to open a spreadsheet and enter everytime you do an exercise is quite painful and demanding mentally.

What if you could do that from anywhere with a very user friendly application? Now we are talking. This next thing made a big difference in my ability to track data in my life.

# Introduction to Appsheet

We've built together a spreadsheet to track exercises. For now, the usage is not very friendly. You need to open google drive, then google sheet, then navigate to the right tab, and enter data manually.

Let's upgrade our system with an application available on Iphones, androids, and web browsers of any computers. This app will provide us easy to fill forms that will add the data to our spreadsheets for us.

## Setting up Appsheet
For those who want to learn the process of creating the app you can follow my tutorial in the [Documentation](https://docs.keepintracks.com//tutorials/appsheet/health-tracking-app.html).

Or you can follow the Documentation on [How to clone my existing templates](https://docs.keepintracks.com/tutorials/appsheet/index.html#copy-an-existing-app)

## Eliminating frustrations
Did you know that Virgin airlines was born from a frustration? I urge you to read the story of Richard Branson, or even just this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2769ua/this_is_how_richard_branson_started_virgin/) about all the company started.

By being proactive about things that generates frustrations in your life, you'll free yourself of this negativity all while giving yourself the chance to discover ideas or opportunities.

What about what we can't control? Find a way to free yourself from the permanent feeling of frustration. For example, if poverty is a frustration to you but feel like you can't contribute to make changes, maybe volunteer one sunday everymonth to an organization so you feel you at least did what you had power to do as an individual.
