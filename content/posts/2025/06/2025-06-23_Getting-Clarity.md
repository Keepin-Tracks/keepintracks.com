# Why are you here, reading this?
Circumstances. Luck. Pure randomness. Purpose in your actions?

# How do you make the decision to stay or to leave?
Time? Subject? How it makes you feel? Does it answer your need?

# Are you internalizing the content or browsing through?
Are you reading waiting to have a better idea of what to do, just like waiting for someone to end speaking to tell your story?
Are you taking the time to relate with words, and thinking about how it could apply in your life?

So many options, so many level of consciousness, so many thoughts, so many distractions.

Life is like this. You can be distracted the whole trip, and end at a destination or be present, conscious and determined to end at your destination.

# Starting to draw a destination
The destination you think you want to go will change in time, but the path and the travel is where all the worth is.

Let's start today, to imprit our minds with a destination we want to go to. As we will change as a person through time, we will come back and adapt it to our new 

1. Create a new spreadsheet "Mind" or "Mindfulness".
    - Remember, we are going to focus on the 3 main life categories that are: Health, Mind and Wealth.
2. Create a new tab named "Clarity"
3. Add the following columns
    - Question: Text
    - Answer: Text
    - Date answered: Date
        - This will help us know which question to revised after a certain time
4. Create another tab named "Question"
5. Add the following columns
    - Question: Text
    - Answer: Text
    - Date answered: Date

## Filling you questions database
Now when you encounter great questions in books or life, record them in the question tab. We can even go back to that tab and add a new column "Rating" of type rating. So we know which questions to spend more time on.
Believe me, it might come handy when you have 100 questions to answer in your list.

For example, let's add the following question: "What excites or would excite you the most in life?"

Spend some time thinking about it and take the time to answer it properly. So many times have I took notes of great questions, which I never took the time to pause, answer and reflect on it.

Once you're finished writing your answer, you might find that the display is not really great. I like to make all text in my sheets to wrap itself on a second line when it gets too long. If you want to try click in the top left corner of the sheet to select all cells and then press the text wrapping icon to wrap the text.

## Take pauses in life
I went to take a walk for 45 minutes. I now fill the need to track duration for my Walking exercise. Let's add this column to my ExerciseEntry tab in my Health tracking system. Column name will be Duration and type will be None but by selecting the column we can then format it to duration by selecting the number format in the task bar instead of the table settings.

## Back to clarity
We will ask ourselves questions that will enable us to gain greater clarity on why we must do what needs to be done to reach our vision or goal.

1. Let's add a column "Goal" of type text in the Clarity tab.
    - We will eventually add a Goal tab, and then we will be able to change the type to a dropdown from range, but not now.
2. Add the following question: "Who do I need to become to reach my goal?"
    - Describe the goal in the right column
    - Take your time to answer properly
3. Finally, let's create the "Goal" tab right now with one column "Goal" of type Text
4. Change the Goal column type from Clarity to a drowdown from range pointing to the new Goal tab "(Goal!A2:A)"

### Find ressources
The question I gave you came from Darren Hardy. I will continue by using his Compound Effect worksheet to create a clear vision of what I need to do, or not do, and become.
[Here is his worksheet](https://darrenhardy.com/resources/compound-effect/The-Compound-Effect-Worksheets_DarrenHardy.pdf)

You can use your own questions, or other questions. There are plenty of resources throughout the web and books. You can look up Tim Ferrris, Tony Robins, Brian Tracy, Jim Rohn, Dave Ramsey, Seth Godin.
Take the questions that makes sense for you and makes you feel empowered and energized to follow through with your goal.

For the purpose of providing resources of other people and giving them the credit they deserves, I will add a column "Source" that I will fill when using other people's content.

I hope you will take the time to clarify your vision for your goal and life.

Keep track of your life, keep track of your habits!
