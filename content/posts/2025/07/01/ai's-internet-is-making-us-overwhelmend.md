# How I made 66 thousands in the last month with AI!
These catchy titles are everywhere on YouTube once you click on one such video. Are they real facts telling videos? Maybe, who knows?

What if it's real and he is giving the recipe to replicate his success? What if it is fake and you lose time and money trying to replicate it.

With AI people are putting out content faster than ever and it's getting the internet supercharged with content that all looks alike. So many FOMO (Fear of missing out) titles and articles everywhere.
This is true when you browsing on YouTube, but it is the same thing on every social media.

The addiction is real. We are telling ourselves that we are scrolling in conviction we are going to find THE video or THE article or THE post that will bring validation to ourselves. Everything displaying contradictions to our values we dismiss, just like every smoker out there that dismiss the shocking images on top of their cartridge.

"Cancer of the lungs and a hole in the neck to breath from? Nah, it won't happen to me today. I just need my relief right now and this won't happen now, so I can disregard this information. It ain't valuable in the moment." - Subconscious mind of a smoker

# How you are failing at life if you don't do this thing right here I discovered yesterday which pays me a great amount in sponsoring
I am well aware that my previous section was written in a way that I was pointing at you and knowing what and how you are living. It ain't true. This kind of writting and accusation is everywhere and makes us FOMO even more, because when well done, it makes us related to the content and feel like we are not enough in the moment since we are in the wrong.

I feel like the effects of internet and over consumption of content has still not been grasp by studies, but yet my studies consumption is not great.

Like the Bee Gees sang in their iconic song: "So we can try, to understand, The New York Times effect on Man!" - Stayin Alive.

This particular lyrics always stuck with me, because it is so much larger than the New York Times. It was sang before internet and social medias. Now with algorithms controlling which content with consume, it is even more import to comprehend the effect of those on our lives, behaviours and subconscious. As individuals, but more as a society.

# Niche is the new gold era
With globalization, internet, drop shipping, and then digitalization of paid services and products, any one can reach a very niche group of people. This can be beneficial when bringing value to specific groups. But it can be negative when influencing such groups against another group with over tailored content feeded on a continuous basis to the first group to solidify their beliefs against second group. We can become isolated in our own group and lose our mind openness and become violent, in thoughts, words, or even actions depending on strength of our beliefs.

# Conclusion
Build your own conclusion. Feed your self on your own decisions of which content you consume.
Be conscious when scrolling. Be conscious in your life.

What do you have to show the world when you create content? Are you providing value or just fishing for reactions?

What are you hoping for when you consume content? Are you fishing for validation or researching and learning in relation to your goals and things you actually when to do in your life?

These 2 questions, I find important to remind myself to ask them regularly, weekly. How do I do that. I track my thoughts. I track my mind.

Keep a journal. Write your thoughts. Develop your consciousness about your decisions. This is the greatest gift to give yourself, not the brand new car at the dealership.
