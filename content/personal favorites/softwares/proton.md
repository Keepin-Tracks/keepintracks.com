# Description
Proton offers a few different products all around the goal of keeping your data private.

First, there is [Proton mail](https://proton.me/mail) which is an email provider. I love this one because it does an awesome job at blocking all junks.
Second, there is [Proton pass](https://proton.me/pass) which is a password manager. I use this one to generate and save all my passwords. With the use of their browser extension or mobile app I can then easily access all my accounts securely.
