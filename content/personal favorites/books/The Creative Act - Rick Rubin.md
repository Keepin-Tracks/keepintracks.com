# Why

For years now, I have had an interested in most of Rick Rubin's work. When his book came out, I felt the need to listen to the audible version, which ended up being more than what I hoped for. I am now in the process of taking the time to read the physical version and take notes through it in order to make sure I embody all the material that matters to me.

# What

As I read and take notes, I will fill this place with meaningful material you will get from reading the book.
