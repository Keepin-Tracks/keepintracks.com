# Why

*The Compound Effect* because is a no-nonsense framework for building momentum and consistency in my life. Darren Hardy’s approach breaks down how small, disciplined actions done repeatedly over time create massive, lasting results. I have read the book a few years ago, but I am now getting out again to try and implement the teachings to take back control of my physical life and health. 

# What

As I continue reading and internalizing the material, I’ll try to use this space to share key takeaways, practical applications, and quotes that resonate.
