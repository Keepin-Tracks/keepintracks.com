# Aeropress Coffee & Espresso Maker
## How
Discovered this tool with the help of the great Tim Ferriss and his book the 4 hour chef.

Gotta say I don't have the discipline to take and spend the time on making an artisanal coffee every morning, but when I do I always appreciate the result.

## Why
It feels good to take a slow morning and start it with yourself pressing down on the Aeropress to push down into your cup the last few drops of coffee.

Then you through it in the sink without any risk of breaking it (No glass). Damn I love it when there's no risk of breaking something! 

What about cleaning it? Just rinse and it's done!

## Where
In the last 10 years, I am now at my second one. I had washed the first one too many times and too hard with the green side of the sponge. The plastic started to show some dents and roughness which I didn't appreciate. 100% my fault.
